Plan of attack:
Create function that calculates path for creep based on it's remembered target
Stores that path into its memory and follows that
Main function loops through list of creeps (what is going to happen array order changes by removing a creep?)
And re-paths 1/per tick max



*****
CURRENTLY when spawned the creep cannot get itself to a state where it finds
targets and paths by itself, have to manually give it a target & path to start
This causes crashes at the moment ... oops
